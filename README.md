## Dataset Content

- The dataset used for this project is supplied by Code Institute and sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves).
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields.The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. 
The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

1. The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
2. The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
3. The client is interested in having the option to download a prediction report for the examined leaves.
4. It was agreed with the client to attain an accuracy rate of 97%.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?

Hypothesis: The machine learning model can accurately predict with the use of images whether a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew based on its features

Validation: By following a systematic approach that includes data preparation, model training, and evaluation of healthy cherry leaves images and those that contain powdery mildew. 

Cherry leaves containing powdery mildew can be distinguished from healthy leaves by their appearance. This is verified by creating an average image study and an image montage to determine the differences in the appearance of both contaminated leaves and healthy leaves.
Contaminated leaves and healthy leaves can be determined with a 97% accuracy, this will be verified by evaluating the model on the test dataset, which achieves 99% accuracy.

## The rationale to map the business requirements

### Business Requirement 1: Data Visualisation
- Display the mean and standard deviation images for mildew-infected and uninfected cherry leaves.
- Display the difference between average mildew-infected and uninfected leaves.
- Display an image montage for either mildew-infected or uninfected leaves.
### Business Requirement 2: Classification and Prediction
- Build an ML model and use it to perform predictions based on whether leaves are infected or not, with an accuracy rating of at least 97%.

## ML Business Case

1. Business Objective
    - Objective: By using an ML model we will solve the problem of differentiating between healthy and powdery mildew cherry leaves saving Farmy & Foods many hours of labour used for the current manual process.
    - Business impact: To improve Farmy & Foods crop current health monitoring process, leading to reduced crop losses and maintaining the highest customer satisfaction.
2. Business Problem
    - Description & Challenges: Farmy & Foods is currently spending many hours of manual inspection is time-consuming and prone to errors when trying to identify cherry leaves affected with powdery mildew, leading to ineffective treatments and crop losses.
    - Goals: To make use of an ML model to automatically and accurately identify cherry leaves affected with powdery mildew with at least 97% accuracy.
3. Proposed Solution
    - ML Approach: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model will be developed to classify between healthy and affected with powdery mildew leaf images.
    - Data Requirements: An image data set consisting of images of both healthy and affected with powdery mildew leaves.
4. Business Value
    - By using this model, we expect to quickly and accurately detect affected crops, allowing for early treatments, healthier plants and satisfied customers. Success will be measured by the model's accuracy and how well it works in detecting affected leaves. The benefits will include fewer crop losses and better quality harvests.
5. Risk Mitigation
    - Data Quality: Use strong methods to collect and prepare image data, including adding variety and checking quality, to ensure the dataset is diverse and of high-quality.
    - Model Performance: The model might not reach the required accuracy, so it will be refined by using cross-validation and repeated testing.
    - User: Users might resist the new system. To help, the dashboard withh be user-friendly and simple to use and understand, detailed guides, support, and explanations are available.
    - Data privacy: NDAs and ethical guidelines will be followed to keep cherry leaf images and related data confidential and secure.
6. Implementation Plan
    - Data collection & processing 
    - Model development & training 
    - Model evaluation, testing, optimization and deployment

## Dashboard Design

### Page 1 - Project Summary

Page includes some general background on the project, the client, and the reason for the project's inception. 
- The business requirements of the project are stated, as well as details of the dataset.
- The project hypothesis is outlined, linking the business needs with the requirements of the project
- The conclusions of the project are stated, with success measured against the desired business outcomes.

### Page 2 - Leaves Visualiser

This page displays the image plots generated from the DataVisualisation notebook, which answer business requirement 1. Shown are:
- Images displaying the mean and variance for healthy leaves(set 0), and unhealthy leaves(set 1)
- An image showing the visual difference between an average healthy and unhealthy leaf
- An image montage creator, with the option to generate an image montage of either healthy or unhealthy leaves from the dataset

### Page 3 - Mildew Detection

The mildew detection page fulfils business requirement 2, providing the ability for a user to upload images for predicting if mildew is present
- Includes link to dataset for prediction use
- Image upload widget, with the ability to upload multiple image files. These are then standardised and fed into the ML model.
- The images are displayed, with their infection status prediction and probability
- A button allows the user to download a report with prediction details of the images they have uploaded 

### Page 4 - ML Performance

This page summarises the performance metrics of the machine learning model used in the project. Show are:
- A bar graph summarising the data split between the different sets, per label
- Line graphs displaying the accuracy and loss trends for the model
- A summary of the generalised performance of the model on the test data set
